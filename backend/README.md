# :car: Drivy Backend Challenge

This is my implementation of the Drivy Backend Challenge :tada:

## Usage

```
cd backend
rvm use # if you use RVM
bundle install
```

As pointed in the original README, each level can be launched as following

```
ruby main.rb
```

Launching from outside of the level floder also works


## Tests

As a beginner with test programming, I only wrote one test per level checking that the expected output matches the `Main#run` class method outputs

Tests can be run with

```
rspec
```

## About the "one commit" per level rule ...

You will find 8 commits instead of 5 :grin:.

- after level 1 commit, you will find two refactoring commits that I'll be glad to discuss :wink:
- after level 5 commit, I added one last refactoring and commenting commit

Looking forward to discussing with you !

Have a nice review :eyes:
